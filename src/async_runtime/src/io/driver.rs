//! IO driver based on MIO selector that is able to integrate with async world.
//!
//! The driver [`IoDriver`] is responsible for holding all objects required by MIO, connected registrations [`RegistrationInfo`]
//! and to provide interface for worker to poll IO events. The driver also provides further striped access to
//! certain functionalities:
//!
//!  - [`IoDriverHandle`] is a proxy that is able to register and deregister IO sources in a safe way.
//!  - [`IoDriverUnparker`] is a proxy that is able to unpark connected IO Driver. This object is used across worker via [`AsyncScheduler`]
//!    to wakeup worker that is currently waiting on MIO poll.
//!
//! The driver has to entry point contexts that should be looked into:
//!  - [`IoDriver`] `process_io` is called by worker to poll IO events and wake up all tasks that are registered for IO events that are ready.
//!  - [`IoDriverHandle`] via `add_io_source` and `remove_io_source` are called by upper layers to register and deregister IO sources in a safe way.
//!    This can be  called from any other worker thread once user uses some async IO API.
//!
//!
//! Explainer Sequence diagrams can be found in the [sequence diagram](../../doc/io_driver.md)
//!
