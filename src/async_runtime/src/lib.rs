//! # Async Runtime Crate
//!
//! `async_runtime` is a library that provides a customizable `async/await` runtime for concurrent programming.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! ## Engines
//! The runtime can consist of multiple execution engines. Each engine can be added using [`crate::runtime::async_runtime::AsyncRuntimeBuilder::with_engine`] and configured through the [`crate::scheduler::execution_engine::ExecutionEngineBuilder`] interface.
//!
//! Engines allow you to separate different aspects of your application, such as running different components with different priorities.
//!
//! Each engine provides the following features:
//! - Configuration of `thread priority` for all async workers
//! - Configuration of `affinity` for all async workers
//! - Creation of dedicated workers that can run arbitrary code (including blocking operations) without impacting the main async worker pool
//!
//!
//! ### Async Workers
//! Async workers operate within a work-stealing model to balance load efficiently. This means that a `task`
//! spawned on worker N may complete execution on worker M, ensuring optimal resource utilization and throughput.
//!
//!
//! ### Dedicated Workers
//! These are separate, uniquely tagged workers that can be targeted for specific workloads. The key characteristic
//! of dedicated workers is task locality - when you spawn a `task` on such a worker, it will always execute on that
//! specific worker, even if the task needs to yield and be woken up later.
//!
//! This guarantees that when a task is resumed via its `Waker`, it will always continue execution on the same thread
//! where it was originally spawned, providing strong execution locality guarantees when needed.
