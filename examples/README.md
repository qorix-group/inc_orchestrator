- Setting up an event receiver program that listens for events
- Coordinating two separate processes through IPC events
- Real-world inter-process orchestration patterns

Run both programs simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the receiver
bazel run //examples:inter_process_event_receiver

### camera_drv_object_det (Multi-Design Example)

A comprehensive real-world example demonstrating a camera driver with object detection pipeline using multiple coordinated orchestration designs and C++/Rust interoperability.

This example shows:

- **Multi-design orchestration** - Three separate designs working together (timer, camera driver, object detection)
- **Cross-design event coordination** - Designs triggering events consumed by other designs
- **C++/Rust interoperability** - Using the `#[import_from_cpp]` macro to call C++ methods from orchestration
- **Method-based actions** - Registering struct methods as invoke actions with `register_invoke_method`
- **Complex execution pipeline** - Sequential camera processing followed by parallel object detection
- **Shared state management** - Using `Arc<Mutex<T>>` to share stateful components across actions

The execution flow:

1. **Timer Design** - Periodically triggers the timer event
2. **Camera Driver Design** - Waits for timer event, then:
   - Reads input from camera
   - Processes the image
   - Writes output
   - Triggers object detection event
3. **Object Detection Design** - Waits for trigger event, then:
   - Pre-processes the data
   - Runs three parallel detection queues (Q1, Q2, Q3) implemented in C++
   - Fuses the results from all queues

The C++ integration uses the `EXPOSE_OBJECT_TO_ORCHESTRATION` macro to export C++ class methods to the orchestration framework, demonstrating seamless interoperability between languages.

Run the complete pipeline:

```bash
bazel run //examples/camera_drv_object_det:camera_drv_object_det
```

**Key concepts:** Multi-design orchestration, cross-design events, C++/Rust FFI, `#[import_from_cpp]` macro, method-based actions, stateful components, parallel pipelines

## Orchestration Design Pattern

Most examples follow this common pattern:

1. **Design Creation** - Create a `Design` with configuration and register events/actions

   ```rust
   let mut design = Design::new("ExampleDesign".into(), DesignConfig::default());
   design.register_event("my_event".into())?;
   ```

2. **Program Registration** - Add programs with their execution logic using builders

   ```rust
   design.add_program("MyProgram", |design_instance, builder| {
       builder.with_run_action(/* action sequence */);
       Ok(())
   });
   ```

3. **Orchestration Setup** - Create orchestration and configure deployment

   ```rust
   let mut orch = Orchestration::new()
       .add_design(design)
       .design_done();
   let mut deployment = orch.get_deployment_mut();
   deployment.bind_events_as_timer(&["my_event".into()], Duration::from_secs(1))?;
   ```

4. **Runtime Integration** - Create Kyron runtime and execute programs

   ```rust
   let (builder, _) = RuntimeBuilder::new().with_engine(/* config */);
   let mut runtime = builder.build()?;
   runtime.block_on(async move { program.run().await });
   ```

Common utilities are provided in the `common/` directory, including reusable event registrations, shared function implementations, and helper utilities.

## Logging

All examples use the `logging_tracing` crate for structured logging. The log output shows:

- Execution flow through action sequences
- Worker assignment and task scheduling
- Event triggering and synchronization
- Error handling and recovery

Adjust the log level by modifying the logger configuration:

```rust
let _logger = LogAndTraceBuilder::new()
    .global_log_level(Level::INFO)  // Change to DEBUG or TRACE for more detail
    .enable_logging(true)
    .build()
    .expect("Failed to build tracing library");
```
